<p>I accept the answer below, but here's an alternate take by Martin Fowler who <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#ServiceLocatorVsDependencyInjection"" rel=""noreferrer"">discusses the merits of Dependency Injection vs. using a Service Locator</a> (which is essentially the same as calling a wrapped <code>ApplicationContext.getBean()</code>).</p>

<p>In part, Fowler states, ""<em>With service locator the application class asks for it [the service] explicitly by a message to the locator. With injection there is no explicit request, the service appears in the application class - hence the inversion of control.
Inversion of control is a common feature of frameworks, but it's something that comes at a price. It tends to be hard to understand and leads to problems when you are trying to debug. So on the whole I prefer to avoid it [Inversion of Control] unless I need it.

<ol>
<li>I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html#sqrt(double)"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Math.sqrt()</code></a>
function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by
restricting yourself to integer-only domain.</li>
<li>Maintaining a lookup table is impractical (since there are about
2<sup>31.5</sup> integers whose square is less than 2<sup>63</sup>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:</p>

<pre><code>public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)
{
  if (n < 0)
    return false;

  long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5);
  return tst*tst == n;
}
</code></pre>

<p><sub>Note: I'm using this function in many <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Project Euler</a> problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>I've tried the different solutions to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>After exhaustive testing, I found that adding <code>0.5</code> to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root"" rel=""noreferrer"">fast inverse square root</a> was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/38426/bobbyshaftoe"">BobbyShaftoe</a>, we can use the FISR hack for n < 410881.</li>
<li>Newton's method was a good bit slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.  This is probably because <code>Math.sqrt()</code> uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.</li>
<li>A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.</li>
<li>Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.</li>
<li>According to John's tests, using <code>or</code> statements is faster in C++ than using a <code>switch</code>, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between <code>or</code> and <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or <code>or</code> statement, I would just say <code>if(lookup[(int)(n&0x3F)]) { test } else return false;</code>.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/299079/why-is-this-code-with-several-or-statements-slightly-faster-than-using-a-lookup-t#299205"">array bounds are checked in Java</a>. </li>

<p>The reason for this is that the Java compiler parses the Unicode character <code>\u000d</code> as a new line and gets transformed into:</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String... args) {

   // The comment below is not a typo.

<p>In my original question, I used IntelliJ Idea. And like @dhke pointed out, IntelliJ got it wrong.
However, I noticed that Idea 2024.1.1 addresses the issue directly. The formatting indicates that it is not a comment.  Additionally, when auto-formatting, it will change  \u000d to an actual new line.

<pre><code>Set<String> flavors = new HashSet<String>() {{
    add(""vanilla"");
    add(""strawberry"");
    add(""chocolate"");
    add(""butter pecan"");
}};
</code></pre>

<p>This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which ""can use any [...] methods in the containing scope"".  </p>

<p>Main question: Is this as <strong>inefficient</strong> as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!)</p>

<p>Second question: The new HashSet must be the ""this"" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?  </p>

<p>Third question: Is this idiom too <strong>obscure</strong> to use in production code?</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it).  </p>

<p>On question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases.  </p>

<p>Question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a ""this"" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat.</p>

<p>Overall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity.  Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals.  Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java.  Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it. However, I plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his SCJP and loves good natured jousts about Java semantics!  ;-)  Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>7/2017: Baeldung <a href=""http://www.baeldung.com/java-double-brace-initialization"" rel=""noreferrer"">has a good summary</a> of double brace initialization and considers it an anti-pattern.</p>

<p>12/2017: @Basil Bourque notes that in the new Java 9 you can say:</p>

<pre><code>Set<String> flavors = Set.of(""vanilla"", ""strawberry"", ""chocolate"", ""butter pecan"");

SDK: jdk1.6.0_21<br>
OS: Windows 7</p>

<p>So I have a strange situation with IntelliJ that has me completely stumped.  I setup a Maven project and add log4j as a dependency in the pom.xml file.  The IDEA inspections run fine and my unit tests all compile and run.</p>

<p>I then added hunnysoft's jmime library to my local maven repository using the mvn install:install-file as follows.</p>

<pre><code>mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jmime.jar -DgroupId=jmime \
-DartifactId=jmime -Dversion=3.1.1e -Dpackaging=jar
</code></pre>

<p>Maven installed the jar file just fine into my local repository.</p>

<p>I then went into IntelliJ's Settings => Maven => Repository Services and Updated my local repository (so that IntelliJ would reindex the repository contents).</p>

<p>Finally, I added the following dependency to my pom.xml file (just above the log4j dependency).</p>

<pre><code><dependency>
    <groupId>jmime</groupId>
    <artifactId>jmime</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.1e</version>
</dependency>
</code></pre>

<p>I now create a new class as follows:</p>

<pre><code>package com.stackoverflow.question;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import com.hunnysoft.jmime.ByteString;
import com.hunnysoft.jmime.Field;
import com.hunnysoft.jmime.FieldBody;

public class StackOverflowQuestion {
    public Field create(String name, String text) {
        Logger.getLogger(getClass()).debug(""create entered"");
        FieldBody body = new FieldBody();
        body.setText(new ByteString(text));
        Field field = new Field();
        field.setFieldName(name);
        field.setFieldBody(body);
        return field;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now for the weirdness.  IntelliJ's intention mechanism picks up and recognizes the Logger import in the maven pom file just fine.  However, for all of the hunnysoft imports it reports: ""Cannot resolve symbol 'ByteString/Field/FieldBody'"", <em>BUT</em> Build => Compile 'StackOverflowQuestion.java' compiles everything correctly and the unit test I created for this class runs fine (though the intentions mark the call to create() as a problem area too).</p>

<p>So somewhere, somehow IntelliJ is ignoring the jmime.jar file for the intention subsystem.  I'm confused because the log4j dependency works fine and everything compiles and runs fine.  F12 (""Go To Declaration"") works on the Logger import, but breaks on all the jmime imports.</p>

<p>Oh, one other thing, if I go to the 'Packages' view in the ""Projects"" window the ""com.hunnysoft.jmime"" package appears and I can see ALL of the classes I imported in the code snippet above under ""Libraries"".  Removing the above dependency from the pom.xml file causes this package to disappear and the compilation breaks.</p>

<p>It appears that the inspection's classpath is broken, but there does not seem to be a setting for this anywhere in the Settings => Intentions | Compiler areas (not that I expected any such settings, I believe the IDEA should already know the correct classpath based on the pom file and JDK).</p>

<p>As a final experiment I created a brand new standard J2SE application project (without using maven) and added the jmime.jar file directly to the project as one of its libraries.  I run into exactly the same problems as described above in this new project.</p>

<p>Here is the MANIFEST.MF from the jmime jar file.</p>

<pre><code>Manifest-Version: 1.0
Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.5.4
Created-By: 10.0-b23 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)

Name: com/hunnysoft/jmime/

Implementation-Title: com.hunnysoft.jmime
Implementation-Version: 3.1.1E
Implementation-Vendor: Hunny Software, Inc.
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see anything unusual in this jar file.</p>

<p>My best guess is that perhaps the problem might be a missing dependency issue.  But AFAIK jmime is supposed to be self contained (JarAnalyzer doesn't come up with anything, but I'm not sure it would if a dependency jar is missing).</p>

<p>So, anyone have any IDEAs?</p>

A cursory glance at the other Xerces questions on SO seem to indicate that almost all Maven users are ""touched"" by this problem at some point.  Unfortunately, understanding the problem requires a bit of knowledge about the history of Xerces...</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Xerces is the most widely used XML parser in the Java ecosystem.  Almost every library or framework written in Java uses Xerces in some capacity (transitively, if not directly).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Xerces jars included in the <a href=""http://xerces.apache.org/mirrors.cgi#binary"" rel=""noreferrer"">official binaries</a> are, to this day, not versioned.  For example, the Xerces 2.11.0 implementation jar is named <code>xercesImpl.jar</code> and not <code>xercesImpl-2.11.0.jar</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Xerces team <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1454?focusedCommentId=12881865&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-12881865"" rel=""noreferrer"">does not use Maven</a>, which means they do not
upload an official release to <a href=""http://search.maven.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maven Central</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Xerces used to be <a href=""http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/faq-general.html#faq-3"" rel=""noreferrer"">released as a single jar</a> (<code>xerces.jar</code>), but was split into two jars, one containing the API (<code>xml-apis.jar</code>) and one containing the implementations of those APIs (<code>xercesImpl.jar</code>).  Many older Maven POMs still declare a dependency on <code>xerces.jar</code>.  At some point in the past, Xerces was also released as <code>xmlParserAPIs.jar</code>, which some older POMs also depend on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The versions assigned to the xml-apis and xercesImpl jars by those who deploy their jars to Maven repositories are often different.  For example, xml-apis might be given version 1.3.03 and xercesImpl might be given version 2.8.0, even though both are from Xerces 2.8.0.  This is because people often tag the xml-apis jar with the version of the specifications that it implements.  There is a very nice, but incomplete breakdown of this <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20140113103608/http://swordsystems.com/2011/06/29/xerces-and-xml-api-dependency-hell/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To complicate matters, Xerces is the XML parser used in the reference implementation of the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP), included in the JRE. The implementation classes are repackaged under the <code>com.sun.*</code> namespace, which makes it dangerous to access them directly, as they may not be available in some JREs.  However, not all of the Xerces functionality is exposed via the <code>java.*</code> and <code>javax.*</code> APIs; for example, there is no API that exposes Xerces serialization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adding to the confusing mess, almost all servlet containers (JBoss, Jetty, Glassfish, Tomcat, etc.), ship with Xerces in one or more of their <code>/lib</code> folders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Problems</h1>
<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
<p>For some -- or perhaps all -- of the reasons above, many
organizations publish and consume custom builds of Xerces in their
POMs.  This is not really a problem if you have a small application and are only using Maven Central, but it quickly becomes an issue for enterprise software where Artifactory or Nexus is proxying multiple repositories (JBoss, Hibernate, etc.):</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Fe9Xa.png"" alt=""xml-apis proxied by Artifactory"" /></p>
<p>For example, organization A might publish <code>xml-apis</code> as:</p>
<pre><code><groupId>org.apache.xerces</groupId>
<artifactId>xml-apis</artifactId>
<version>2.9.1</version>
</code></pre>
<p>Meanwhile, organization B might publish the same <code>jar</code> as:</p>
<pre><code><groupId>xml-apis</groupId>
<artifactId>xml-apis</artifactId>
<version>1.3.04</version>

<p>Although B's <code>jar</code> is a lower version than A's <code>jar</code>, Maven does not know
that they are the same artifact because they have different
<code>groupId</code>s. Thus, it cannot perform conflict resolution and both
<code>jar</code>s will be included as resolved dependencies:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/4X1ts.png"" alt=""resolved dependencies with multiple xml-apis"" /></p>
<h3>Classloader Hell</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the JRE ships with Xerces in the JAXP RI.  While it would be nice to mark all Xerces Maven dependencies as <code><exclusion></code>s or as <code><provided></code>, the third-party code you depend on may or may not work with the version provided in JAXP of the JDK you're using.  In addition, you have the Xerces jars shipped in your servlet container to contend with. This leaves you with a number of choices: Do you delete the servlet version and hope that your container runs on the JAXP version? Is it better to leave the servlet version, and hope that your application frameworks run on the servlet version? If one or two of the unresolved conflicts outlined above manage to slip into your product (easy to happen in a large organization), you quickly find yourself in classloader hell, wondering which version of Xerces the classloader is picking at runtime and whether or not it will pick the same jar in Windows and Linux (probably not).</p>
<h1>Solutions?</h1>
<p>We've tried marking all Xerces Maven dependencies as <code><provided></code> or as an <code><exclusion></code>, but this is difficult to enforce (especially with a large team) given that the artifacts have so many aliases (<code>xml-apis</code>, <code>xerces</code>, <code>xercesImpl</code>, <code>xmlParserAPIs</code>, etc.).  Additionally, our third party libs/frameworks may not run on the JAXP version or the version provided by a servlet container.</p>
<p><strong>How can we best address this problem with Maven?  Do we have to exercise such fine-grained control over our dependencies, and then rely on tiered classloading?  Is there some way to globally exclude all Xerces dependencies, and force all of our frameworks/libs to use the JAXP version?</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Joshua Spiewak has uploaded a patched version of the Xerces build scripts to <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1454"" rel=""noreferrer"">XERCESJ-1454</a> that allows for upload to Maven Central.  Vote/watch/contribute to this issue and let's fix this problem once and for all.</p>

Why?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    public MyClass(int x) {}
}

public class MySubClass extends MyClass {
    public MySubClass(int a, int b) {
        int c = a + b;
        super(c);  // COMPILE ERROR
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Sun compiler says, <code>call to super must be first statement in constructor</code>. The Eclipse compiler says, <code>Constructor call must be the first statement in a constructor</code>.</p>
<p>However, you can get around this by re-arranging the code a little bit:</p>
<pre><code>public class MySubClass extends MyClass {
    public MySubClass(int a, int b) {
        super(a + b);  // OK
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is another example:</p>
<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    public MyClass(List list) {}
}

public class MySubClassA extends MyClass {
    public MySubClassA(Object item) {
        // Create a list that contains the item, and pass the list to super
        List list = new ArrayList();
        list.add(item);
        super(list);  // COMPILE ERROR
    }
}

public class MySubClassB extends MyClass {
    public MySubClassB(Object item) {
        // Create a list that contains the item, and pass the list to super
        super(Arrays.asList(new Object[] { item }));  // OK
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, it is <strong>not stopping you from executing logic</strong> before the call to <code>super()</code>. It is just stopping you from executing logic that you can't fit into a single expression.</p>
<p>There are similar rules for calling <code>this()</code>. The compiler says, <code>call to this must be first statement in constructor</code>.</p>
<p>Why does the compiler have these restrictions? Can you give a code example where, if the compiler did not have this restriction, something bad would happen?</p>

<p>Given a <code>List<E> list</code> object, I know of the following ways to loop through all elements:</p>

<h3>Basic <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.14.1"" rel=""noreferrer"">for</a> <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">loop</a> (of course, there're equivalent <code>while</code> / <code>do while</code> loops as well)</h3>

<pre><code>// Not recommended (see below)!
for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
    E element = list.get(i);
    // 1 - can call methods of element
    // 2 - can use 'i' to make index-based calls to methods of list

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: As @amarseillan pointed out, this form is a poor choice
for iterating over <code>List</code>s, because the actual implementation of
the <code>get</code> method may not be as efficient as when using an <code>Iterator</code>.
For example, <code>LinkedList</code> implementations must traverse all of
the elements preceding i to get the i-th element.</p>

<p>In the above example there's no way for the <code>List</code> implementation to
""save its place"" to make future iterations more efficient. 
For an <code>ArrayList</code> it doesn't really matter, because the complexity/cost of <code>get</code> is constant time (O(1)) whereas for a <code>LinkedList</code> is it proportional to the size of the list (O(n)). </p>

<p>(A map method from Java 8's Stream API (see @i_am_zero's answer).)</p>

<p>In Java 8 collection classes that implement <code>Iterable</code> (for example, all <code>List</code>s) now have a <code>forEach</code> method, which can be used instead of the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.14.1"" rel=""noreferrer"">for loop statement</a> demonstrated above. (Here is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16635398/java-8-iterable-foreach-vs-foreach-loop"">another question</a> that provides a good comparison.)</p>

<pre><code>Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4).forEach(System.out::println);
// 1 - can call methods of an element
// 2 - would need reference to containing object to remove an item
//     (TODO: someone please confirm / deny this)
// 3 - functionally separates iteration from the action
//     being performed with each item.

Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4).stream().forEach(System.out::println);
// Same capabilities as above plus potentially greater
// utilization of parallelism
// (caution: consequently, order of execution is not guaranteed,
// see [Stream.forEachOrdered][stream-foreach-ordered] for more
// information about this).

<p><strong>I was interested though in understanding how / when you distinguish the stores when using keytool.</strong></p>

<p>So, far I've created a keystore using</p>

<pre><code>keytool -import -alias bob -file bob.crt -keystore keystore.ks
</code></pre>

<p>which creates my keystore.ks file. I answer <code>yes</code> to the question do I trust bob but it is unclear to me if this has created a keystore file or a truststore file? I can set up my application to use the file as either.</p>

<pre><code>-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=keystore.ks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=x
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=keystore.ks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=x

I don't seem to be able to find any documentation on this. If there isn't, how can I achieve the same effect?</p>

<p>To make my question more specific, I am writing an application that deals with data and the specification say that there should be a 'reset' button that brings the application back to its original just launched state. However, all data have to be 'live' unless the application is closed or reset button is pressed.</p>

<p>Being usually a C/C++ programmer, I thought this would be trivial to implement. (And hence I planned to implement it last.) I structured my program such that all the 'reset-able' objects would be in the same class so that I can just destroy all 'live' objects when a reset button is pressed.</p>

<p>I was thinking if all I did was just to dereference the data and wait for the garbage collector to collect them, wouldn't there be a memory leak if my user repeatedly entered data and pressed the reset button? I was also thinking since Java is quite mature as a language, there should be a way to prevent this from happening or gracefully tackle this.</p>

<p>I am using Tomcat 6 as webserver. I have two HTTPS web applications installed on different Tomcats on different ports but on the same machine. Say App1 (port 8443) and  App2 (port 443). App1 connects to App2. When App1 connects to App2 I get the above error. I know this is a very common error so came across many solutions on different forums and sites. I have the below entry in <code>server.xml</code> of both Tomcats:</p>
<pre><code>keystoreFile=""c:/.keystore"" 
keystorePass=""changeit""
</code></pre>
<p>Every site says the same reason that certificate given by app2 is not in the trusted store of app1 jvm. This seems to be true also when I tried to hit the same URL in IE browser, it works (with warming, There is a problem with this web site's security certificate. Here I say continue to this website). But when same URL is hit by Java client (in my case) I get the above error. So to put it in the truststore I tried these three options:</p>
<h3>Option 1</h3>
<pre><code>System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""C:/.keystore"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"", ""changeit"");
</code></pre>
<h3>Option 2</h3>
<p>Setting below in environment variable</p>
<pre><code>CATALINA_OPTS -- param name
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=C:\.keystore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit ---param value
</code></pre>
<h3>Option 3</h3>
<p>Setting below in environment variable</p>
<pre><code>JAVA_OPTS -- param name
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=C:\.keystore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit ---param value
</code></pre>
<h3>Result</h3>
<p>But nothing worked.</p>
<p><strong>What at last worked</strong> is executing the Java approach suggested in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1828775/httpclient-and-ssl"">How to handle invalid SSL certificates with Apache HttpClient?</a> by Pascal Thivent i.e. executing the program InstallCert.</p>
<p><strong>But this approach is fine for devbox setup but I can not use it at production environment.</strong></p>
<p>I am wondering why three approaches mentioned above did not work when I have mentioned the same values in <code>server.xml</code> of App2 server and same values in truststore by setting</p>
<p><code>System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""C:/.keystore"") and System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"", ""changeit"");</code></p>
<p>in App1 program.</p>
<p>For more information this is how I am making the connection:</p>
<pre><code>URL url = new URL(urlStr);

URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();

  HttpsURLConnection conn1 = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();

I have had numerous conversations, read things on blogs, read what Bruce Eckel had to say (the first person I saw speak out against them).</p>
<p>I am currently writing some new code and paying very careful attention to how I deal with exceptions.  I am trying to see the point of view of the ""we don't like checked exceptions"" crowd and I still cannot see it.</p>
<p>Every conversation I have ends with the same question going unanswered... let me set it up:</p>
<p>In general (from how Java was designed),</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Error</code> is for things that should never be caught (VM has a peanut allergy and someone dropped a jar of peanuts on it)</li>
<li><code>RuntimeException</code> is for things that the programmer did wrong (programmer walked off the end of an array)</li>
<li><code>Exception</code> (except <code>RuntimeException</code>) is for things that are out of the programmer's control (disk fills up while writing to the file system, file handle limit for the process has been reached and you cannot open any more files)</li>
<li><code>Throwable</code> is simply the parent of all of the exception types.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common argument I hear is that if an exception happens then all the developer is going to do is exit the program.</p>
<p>Another common argument I hear is that checked exceptions make it harder to refactor code.</p>
<p>For the ""all I am going to do is exit"" argument I say that even if you are exiting you need to display a reasonable error message.  If you are just punting on handling errors then your users won't be overly happy when the program exits without a clear indication of why.</p>
<p>For the ""it makes it hard to refactor"" crowd, that indicates that the proper level of abstraction wasn't chosen.  Rather than declare a method throws an <code>IOException</code>, the <code>IOException</code> should be transformed into an exception that is more suited for what is going on.</p>
<p>I don't have an issue with wrapping Main with <code>catch(Exception)</code> (or in some cases <code>catch(Throwable)</code> to ensure that the program can exit gracefully - but I always catch the specific exceptions I need to.  Doing that allows me to, at the very least, display an appropriate error message.</p>
<p>The question that people never reply to is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you throw <code>RuntimeException</code>
subclasses instead of <code>Exception</code>
subclasses then how do you know what
you are supposed to catch?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the answer is catch <code>Exception</code> then you are also dealing with programmer errors the same way as system exceptions.  That seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>If you catch <code>Throwable</code> then you are treating system exceptions and VM errors (and the like) the same way.  That seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>If the answer is that you catch only the exceptions you know are thrown then how do you know what ones are thrown?  What happens when programmer X throws a new exception and forgot to catch it?  That seems very dangerous to me.</p>
<p>I would say that a program that displays a stack trace is wrong.  Do people who don't like checked exceptions not feel that way?</p>
<p>So, if you don't like checked exceptions can you explain why not AND answer the question that doesn't get answered please?</p>
<p>I am not looking for advice on when to use either model, what I am looking for is <em>why</em> people extend from <code>RuntimeException</code> because they don't like extending from <code>Exception</code> and/or why they catch an exception and then rethrow a <code>RuntimeException</code> rather than add throws to their method.  I want to understand the motivation for disliking checked exceptions.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom, as well as a lot of Google results, says that exceptional logic shouldn't be used for normal program flow in Java.  Two reasons are usually given,</p>

<ol>
<li>it is really slow - even an order of magnitude slower than regular code (the reasons given vary),  </li>
</ol>

<p>and </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>it is messy because people expect only errors to be handled in exceptional code.  </li>
</ol>

<p>This question is about #1.</p>

<p>As an example, <a href=""http://leepoint.net/notes-java/flow/exceptions/03exceptions.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this page</a> describes Java exception handling as ""very slow"" and relates the slowness to the creation of the exception message string - ""this string is then used in creating the exception object that is thrown. This is not fast.""  The article <a href=""http://adtmag.com/articles/2000/08/22/effective-exception-handling-in-java.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Effective Exception Handling in Java</a> says that ""the reason for this is due to the object creation aspect of exception handling, which thereby makes throwing exceptions inherently slow"".  Another reason out there is that the stack trace generation is what slows it down.</p>

<p>My testing (using Java 1.6.0_07, Java HotSpot 10.0, on 32 bit Linux), indicates that exception handling is no slower than regular code.  I tried running a method in a loop that executes some code.  At the end of the method, I use a boolean to indicate whether to <em>return</em> or <em>throw</em>.  This way the actual processing is the same. I tried running the methods in different orders and averaging my test times, thinking it may have been the JVM warming up.  In all my tests, the throw was at least as fast as the return, if not faster (up to 3.1% faster).  I am completely open to the possibility that my tests were wrong, but I haven't seen anything out there in the way of the code sample, test comparisons, or results in the last year or two that show exception handling in Java to actually be slow.</p>

<p>What leads me down this path was an API I needed to use that threw exceptions as part of normal control logic.  I wanted to correct them in their usage, but now I may not be able to.  Will I instead have to praise them on their forward thinking?</p>

<p>In the paper <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=337453"" rel=""noreferrer"">Efficient Java exception handling in just-in-time compilation</a>, the authors suggest that the presence of exception handlers alone, even if no exceptions are thrown, is enough to prevent the JIT compiler from optimizing the code properly, thus slowing it down.  I haven't tested this theory yet.</p>

<h1>Brief discussion</h1>

<p>My test code contains mainly text parsing, replacing and Regex searches, perhaps for other code (e.g. more numeric operations) the results would be different. On all devices with ARM processors, Java performed better than Xamarin C# code. The largest difference was under Android 2.3, where C# code run at approx. 70% of Java speed.</p>

<p>On Intel emulator (with Intel HAX technology, emulator runs in fast virt mode), Xamarin C# code runs my sample code much faster than Java - about 1.35 time faster. Maybe Mono virtual machine code and libraries are much better optimized on Intel than on ARM?</p>

<h1>Edit July 8, 2013</h1>

<p>I just installed Genymotion Android emulator, which runs in Oracle VirtualBox, and again this one uses native Intel processor, not emulating ARM processor. As with Intel HAX emulator, again C# runs here much faster. Here are my results:</p>

<h3>Genymotion emulator - Intel (Android 4.1.1, API 16)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java:
  Grand total time (5 runs): 2069 ms, with file reading total: 2248 ms</p>
  
  <p>C#:
  Grand total time (5 runs): 1543 ms, with file reading total: 1642 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then noticed that there was an update to Xamarin.Android beta, version 4.7.11, with release notes mentioning some changes in Mono runtime as well. Decided to quickly test some ARM devices, and big surprise - C# numbers improved:</p>

<h3>BN Nook XD+, ARM (Android 4.0)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 8103 ms, with file reading total: 8569 ms</p>
  
  <p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 7951 ms, with file reading total: 8161 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow! C# is now better than Java? Decided to repeat the test on my Galaxy Note 2:</p>

<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - ARM (Android 4.1.1)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 9675 ms, with file reading total: 10028 ms</p>
  
  <p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 9911 ms, with file reading total: 10104 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here C# seems to be only slightly slower, but these numbers gave me a pause: Why the time is longer than on Nook HD+, even though Note 2 has a faster processor? The answer: power saving mode. On Nook, it was disabled, on Note 2 - enabled. Decided to test with power saving mode disabled (as with enabled, it also limits the processor speed):</p>

<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - ARM (Android 4.1.1), power saving disabled</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 7153 ms, with file reading total: 7459 ms</p>
  
  <p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 6906 ms, with file reading total: 7070 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, surprisingly, C# is slightly faster than Java on ARM processor as well. Big improvement!</p>

<h1>Edit July 12, 2013</h1>

<p>We all know, that nothing beats native code for speed, and I was not satisfied with the performance of my sentence splitter in Java or C#, particularly that I need to improve it (and thus make it even slower). Decided to re-write it in C++. Here is a small (i.e. a smaller set of files than previous tests, for other reasons) comparison of the speed of native vs. Java on my Galaxy Note 2, with power saving mode disabled:</p>

<p>Java:
Grand total time (5 runs): 3292 ms, with file reading total: 3454 ms</p>

<p>Native thumb:
Grand total time (5 runs): 537 ms, with file reading total: 657 ms</p>

<p>Native arm:
Grand total time (5 runs): 458 ms, with file reading total: 587 ms</p>

<p>Looks like for my particular test, the native code is 6 to 7 times faster than Java. Caveat: could not use std::regex class on Android, so had to write my own specialized routines searching for paragraphs breaks or html tags. My initial tests of the same code on a PC using regex, were about 4 to 5 times faster than Java.</p>

<p>Phew! Waking raw memory with char* or wchar* pointers again, I instantly felt 20 years younger! :)</p>

<h1>Edit July 15, 2013</h1>

<p><strong><em>(Please see below, with edits of 7/30/2013, for much better results with Dot42)</em></strong></p>

<p>With some difficulty, I managed to port my C# tests to Dot42 (version 1.0.1.71 beta), another C# platform for Android. Preliminary results show that Dot42 code is about 3x (3 times) slower than Xamarin C# (v. 4.7.11), on an Intel Android emulator. One problem is that System.Text.RegularExpressions class in Dot42 does not have the Split() function that I used in Xamarin tests, so I used Java.Util.Regex class instead, and Java.Util.Regex.Pattern.Split(), so in this particular place in the code, there is this small difference. Should not be a big problem though. Dot42 compiles to Dalvik (DEX) code, so it cooperates with Java on Android natively, does not need expensive interop from C# to Java like Xamarin.</p>

<p>Just for comparison, I also run the test on ARM devices - here the Dot42 code is ""only"" 2x slower than Xamarin C#. Here are my results:</p>

<p>To me, it was also interesting to note that Xamarin C# is slightly faster than Java on a newer ARM device and slightly slower on the old Nexus One. If anyone would like to run these tests as well, please let me know and I'll update the sources on GitHub. It would be particularly interesting to see results from a real Android device with Intel processor.</p>

<h2>Update 7/26/2013</h2>

<p>Just a quick update, re-compiled by benchmark apps with the latest Xamarin.Android 4.8, and also with dot42 1.0.1.72 update released today - no significant changes from the results reported before.</p>

<h2>Update 7/30/2013 - better results for dot42</h2>

<p>Re-tested Dot42 with Robert's (from dot42 makers) port of my Java code to C#. In my C# port done initially for Xamarin, I replaced some native Java classes, like ListArray, with List class native to C#, etc. Robert did not have my Dot42 source code, so he ported it again from Java and used original Java classes in such places, which benefits Dot42, I guess because it runs in Dalvik VM, like Java, and not in Mono, like Xamarin. Now Dot42 results are much better. Here is a log from my testing:</p>

<p>I still think that Dot42 has a long way to go. Having Java-like classes (e.g. ArrayList) and a good performance with them would make porting code from Java to C# slightly easier. However, this is something I would not be likely to do a lot. I would rather want to use existing C# code (libraries etc.), which will use native C# classes (e.g. List), and that would perform slowly with the current dot42 code, and very well with Xamarin.</p>

As of Java 8, static methods are allowed in interfaces.  However, they cannot be declared abstract (required to be overridden) in the manner requested by this question.</em></p>
<p>Why can't I define a static method in a Java interface?</p>
<p>Here's the example:</p>
<pre><code>public interface IXMLizable<T>
{
  static T newInstanceFromXML(Element e);
  Element toXMLElement();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This won't work.  But why not?</p>
<p>One of the possible issues would be, what happens when you call:</p>
<pre><code>IXMLizable.newInstanceFromXML(e);
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, I think it should just call an empty method (i.e. <code>{}</code>).  All subclasses would be forced to implement the static method, so they'd all be fine when calling the static method.  So why isn't this possible?</p>
<p>I guess I'm looking for answer that's deeper than ""because that's the way Java is"".</p>
<p>Is there a particular technological reason why static methods can't be overwritten? That is, why did the designers of Java decide to make instance methods overrideable but not static methods?</p>
<p>The problem with my design is I'm trying to use interfaces to enforce a coding convention.</p>
<p>That is, the goal of the interface is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I want the <code>IXMLizable</code> interface to allow me to convert classes that implement it to XML elements (using polymorphism works fine).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If someone wants to make a new instance of a class that implements the IXMLizable interface, they will always know that there will be a <code>newInstanceFromXML(Element e)</code> static factory method.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Is there any other way to ensure this, other than just putting a comment in the interface?</p>

<p>I've broken the SQL statements semantically into several concatenated strings over several lines of code for ease of maintenance. So instead of something like:</p>

<pre><code>String query = ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ FROM ABC WHERE BAR > 4"";
</code></pre>

<p>I have something like:</p>

<pre><code>String query =
    ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ"" +
    ""  FROM ABC          "" +
    "" WHERE BAR > 4      "";
</code></pre>

<p>This style makes the SQL much easier to read and maintain (IMHO), especially for larger queries. For example, I can put my editor into ""overwrite"" mode and modify the text in-place fairly easily.</p>

<p><strong>Note that this issue generalizes beyond the particular example of SQL. Any code that is written with any vertical formatting, particularly tabular constructs, is susceptible to destruction by a pretty printer.</strong></p>

<p>Now, some project members use the Eclipse editor and the semantic formatting is often destroyed when they format an entire source file.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to instruct Eclipse to ignore certain lines of source with respect to formatting?</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking for something like a special comment that toggles the Eclipse formatter. Ideally, such a comment could be configurable to be whatever we choose, and other formatters could be programmed to respect it as well:</p>

<pre><code>// STOP-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING
String query =
    ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ"" +
    ""  FROM ABC          "" +
    "" WHERE BAR > 4      "";
// START-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, one ""solution"" is to have our team members standardize on some external formatter like <a href=""http://www.triemax.com/products/jalopy/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jalopy</a> or <a href=""http://www.jindent.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JIndent</a>, but that's not what this question is about (also, not my decision on this project): I'm specifically looking for a way to avoid the Eclipse formatter on an ad-hoc basis.</p>

<p>Ideally, a solution will allow me to insert instructions for the Eclipse formatter <strong>without requiring team members using Eclipse to do any IDE reconfiguration</strong> (other than possibly choosing a formatter agnostic command comment: <code>STOP-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING</code> → <code>STOP-FORMATTING</code>).</p>

Hopefully to be included in many other projects.</p>
<p>For logging I (and indeed the people I work with) have always used JUL (<code>java.util.logging</code>) and never had any issues with it. However now I need to understand in more detail what I should do for my API development. I've done some research on this and with the information I've got I just get more confused. Hence this post.</p>
<p>Since I come from JUL I'm biased on that. My knowledge of the rest is not that big.</p>
<p>From the research I've done I've come up with these reasons why people do not like JUL:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>""I started developing in Java long before Sun released JUL and it was just easier for me to continue with logging-framework-X rather than to learn something new""</em>. Hmm. I'm not kidding, this is actually what people say. With this argument we could all be doing COBOL. (however I can certainly relate to this being a lazy dude myself)</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>""I don't like the names of the logging levels in JUL""</em>. Ok, seriously, this is just not enough of a reason to introduce a new dependency.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>""I don't like the standard format of the output from JUL""</em>. Hmm. This is just configuration. You do not even have to do anything code-wise. (true, back in old days you may have had to create your own Formatter class to get it right).</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>""I use other libraries that also use logging-framework-X so I thought it easier just to use that one""</em>. This is a circular argument, isn't ? Why does 'everybody' use logging-framework-X and not JUL?</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>""Everybody else is using logging-framework-X""</em>. This to me is just a special case of the above. Majority is not always right.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So the real big question is <strong>why not JUL?</strong>. What is it I have missed ? The raison d'être for logging facades (SLF4J, JCL) is that multiple logging implementations have existed historically and the reason for that really goes back to the era before JUL as I see it. If JUL was perfect then logging facades wouldn't exist, or what? To make matters more confusing JUL is to some extent a facade itself, allowing Handlers, Formatters and even the LogManager to be swapped.</p>
<p>Rather than embracing multiple ways of doing the same thing (logging), shouldn't we question why they were necessary in the first place? (and see if those reasons still exist)</p>
<p>Ok, my research so far has led to a couple of things that I can see may be <strong>real issues</strong> with JUL:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Performance</strong>. Some say that performance in SLF4J is superior to the rest. This seems to me to be a case of premature optimization. If you need to log hundreds of megabytes per second then I'm not sure you are on the right path anyway. JUL has also evolved and the tests you did on Java 1.4 may no longer be true. You can read about it <a href=""http://jeremymanson.blogspot.dk/2009/04/faster-logging-with-faster-logger.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and this fix has made it into Java 7. Many also talk about the overhead of string concatenation in logging methods. However template based logging avoids this cost and it exist also in JUL. Personally I never really write template based logging. Too lazy for that. For example if I do this with JUL:</p>
<pre><code> log.finest(""Lookup request from username="" + username 
    + "", valueX="" + valueX
    + "", valueY="" + valueY));
</code></pre>
<p>my IDE will warn me and ask permission that it should change it to:</p>
<pre><code> log.log(Level.FINEST, ""Lookup request from username={0}, valueX={1}, valueY={2}"", 
    new Object[]{username, valueX, valueY});
</code></pre>
<p>.. which I will of course accept. Permission granted ! Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>So I don't actually write such statements myself, that is done by the IDE.</p>
<p>In conclusion on the issue of performance I haven't found anything that would suggest that JUL's performance is not ok compared to the competition.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration from classpath</strong>. Out-of-the-box JUL cannot load a configuration file from the classpath. It is a <a href=""https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=4958543"" rel=""noreferrer"">few lines of code</a> to make it do so. I can see why this may be annoying but the solution is short and simple.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Availability of output handlers</strong>. JUL comes with 5 output handlers out-of-the-box: console, file stream, socket and memory. These can be extended or new ones can be written. This may for example be writing to UNIX/Linux Syslog and Windows Event Log. I have personally never had this requirement nor have I seen it used but I can certainly relate to why it may be a useful feature. Logback comes with an appender for Syslog for example. Still I would argue that</p>
<ol>
<li>99.5% of the needs for output destinations are covered by what is in JUL out-of-the-box.</li>
<li>Special needs could be catered for by custom handlers on top of JUL rather than on top of something else. There's nothing to me that suggests that it takes more time to write a Syslog output handler for JUL than it does for another logging framework.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm really concerned that there's something I've overlooked. The use of logging facades  and logging implementations other than JUL is so widespread that I have to come to the conclusion that it's me who just doesn't understand. That wouldn't be the first time, I'm afraid. :-)</p>
<p>So what should I do with my API?  I want it to become successful.  I can of course just ""go with the flow"" and implement SLF4J (which seems the most popular these days) but for my own sake I still need to understand exactly what is wrong with the JUL of today that warrants all the fuzz?  Will I sabotage myself by choosing JUL for my library ?</p>
<h2>Testing performance</h2>
<p><em>(section added by nolan600 on 07-JUL-2012)</em></p>
<p>There's a reference below from Ceki about SLF4J's parametrization being 10 times or more faster than JUL's. So I've started doing some simple tests. At first glance the claim is certainly correct. Here are the preliminary results (but read on!):</p>
<ul>
<li>Execution time SLF4J, backend Logback: 1515</li>
<li>Execution time SLF4J, backend JUL: 12938</li>
<li>Execution time JUL: 16911</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers above are msecs so less is better. So 10 times performance difference is by first actually pretty close. My initial reaction: That is a lot !</p>
<p>Here is the core of the test. As can be seen an integer and a string is construted in a loop which is then used in the log statement:</p>
<pre><code>    for (int i = 0; i < noOfExecutions; i++) {
        for (char x=32; x<88; x++) {
            String someString = Character.toString(x);
            // here we log 
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>(I wanted the log statement to have both a primitive data type (in this case an int) and a more complex data type (in this case a String). Not sure it matters but there you have it.)</p>
<p>The log statement for SLF4J:</p>
<pre><code>logger.info(""Logging {} and {} "", i, someString);
</code></pre>
<p>The log statement for JUL:</p>
<pre><code>logger.log(Level.INFO, ""Logging {0} and {1}"", new Object[]{i, someString});
</code></pre>
<p>The JVM was 'warmed up' with the same test executed once before the actual measurement was done. Java 1.7.03 was used on Windows 7. Latest versions of SLF4J (v1.6.6) and Logback (v1.0.6) was used. Stdout and stderr was redirected to null device.</p>
<p>However, careful now, it turns out JUL is spending most of its time in <code>getSourceClassName()</code> because JUL by default prints the source class name in the output, while Logback doesn't. So we are comparing apples and oranges. I have to do the test again and configure the logging implementations in a similar manner so that they actually output the same stuff. I do however suspect that SLF4J+Logback will still come out on top but far from the initial numbers as given above. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Btw: The test was first time I've actually worked with SLF4J or Logback. A pleasant experience. JUL is certainly a lot less welcoming when you are starting out.</p>
<h2>Testing performance (part 2)</h2>
<p><em>(section added by nolan600 on 08-JUL-2012)</em></p>
<p>As it turns out it doesn't really matter for performance how you configure your pattern in JUL, i.e. whether or not it includes the source name or not. I tried with a very simple pattern:</p>
<pre><code>java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=""%4$s: %5$s [%1$tc]%n""
</code></pre>
<p>and that did not change the above timings at all. My profiler revealed that the logger still spent a lot of time in calls to <code>getSourceClassName()</code> even if this was not part of my pattern. The pattern doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I'm therefore concluding on the issue of performance that at least for the tested template based log statement there seems to be roughly a factor of 10 in real performance difference between JUL (slow) and SLF4J+Logback (quick). Just like Ceki said.</p>
<p>I can also see another thing namely that SLF4J's <code>getLogger()</code> call is a lot more expensive than JUL's ditto. (95 ms vs 0.3 ms if my profiler is accurate). This makes sense. SLF4J has to do some time on the binding of the underlying logging implementation. This doesn't scare me. These calls should be somewhat rare in the lifetime of an application. The fastness should be in the actual log calls.</p>
<h1>Final conclusion</h1>
<p><em>(section added by peterh on 08-JUL-2012)</em></p>
<p>Thank you for all your answers. Contrary to what I initially thought I've ended up deciding to use SLF4J for my API. This is based on a number of things and your input:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It gives flexibility to choose log implementation at deployment time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Issues with lack of flexibility of JUL's configuration when run inside an application server.</p>
</li>
<li><p>SLF4J is certainly a lot faster as detailed above in particular if you couple it with Logback. Even if this was just a rough test I have reason to believe that a lot more effort has gone into optimization on SLF4J+Logback than on JUL.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Documentation. The documentation for SLF4J is simply a lot more comprehensive and precise.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pattern flexibility. As I did the tests I set out to have JUL mimic the default pattern from Logback. This pattern includes the name of the thread. It turns out JUL cannot do this out of the box. Ok, I haven't missed it until now, but I don't think it is a thing that should be missing from a log framework. Period!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most (or many) Java projects today use Maven so adding a dependency is not that big a thing especially if that dependency is rather stable, i.e. doesn't constantly change its API. This seems to be true for SLF4J. Also the SLF4J jar and friends are small in size.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So the strange thing that happened was that I actually got quite upset with JUL after having worked a bit with SLF4J. I still regret that it has to be this way with JUL. JUL is far from perfect but kind of does the job. Just not quite well enough. The same can be said about <code>Properties</code> as an example but we do not think about abstracting that so people can plug in their own configuration library and what have you. I think the reason is that <code>Properties</code> comes in just above the bar while the opposite is true for JUL of today ... and in the past it came in at zero because it didn't exist.</p>
<h1>Final-final conclusion (maybe)</h1>
<p><em>(section added by peterh on 02-OCT-2022)</em></p>
<p>Java 9 introduced the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.Logger.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">System.Logger</a> which is intended as a facade to logging implementations. Hence, as far as I can tell, it competes with SLF4J, but has the advantage that it is included with the JDK. <strong>So perhaps library developers should use System.Logger rather than SLF4J</strong> ?</p>
<p>I find <a href=""https://renato.athaydes.com/posts/java-system-logging.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">this blog post</a> by Renato Athaydes to explain it quite well. (btw: the bug in the Log4j-v2 bridge mentioned by Renato seems to have been <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1360"" rel=""noreferrer"">fixed</a> with v2.13.2 of Log4j v2)</p>

So I decided to try and find out the general best practice for each issue and write this down for personal use.<br>
I would not mind however for anyone to comment on it or to tell me where I'm wrong.</p>

<h2>Entity Class</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>implement Serializable  </p>

<p>Reason: <em>The specification says you have to, but some JPA providers do not enforce this. Hibernate as JPA provider does not enforce this, but it can fail somewhere deep in its stomach with ClassCastException, if Serializable has not been implemented.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Constructors</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>create a constructor with all required fields of the entity </p>

<p><em>Reason: A constructor should always leave the instance created in a sane state.</em>  </p></li>
<li><p>besides this constructor: have a package private default constructor  </p>

<p><em>Reason: Default constructor is required to have Hibernate initialize the entity; private is allowed but package private (or public) visibility is required for runtime proxy generation and efficient data retrieval without bytecode instrumentation.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Fields/Properties</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Use field access in general and property access when needed  </p>

<p><em>Reason:  this is probably the most debatable issue since there are no clear and convincing  arguments for one or the other (property access vs field access); however, field access seems to be general favourite because of clearer code, better encapsulation and no need to create setters for immutable fields</em> </p></li>
<li><p>Omit setters for immutable fields (not required for access type field)</p></li>
<li>properties may be private<br>
Reason: I once heard that protected is better for (Hibernate) performance but all I can find on the web is: <em>Hibernate can access public, private, and protected accessor methods, as well as public, private and protected fields directly. The choice is up to you and you can match it to fit your application design.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Equals/hashCode</h2>

<ul>
<li>Never use a generated id if this id is only set when persisting the entity</li>
<li>By preference: use immutable values to form a unique Business Key and use this to test equality</li>
<li>if a unique Business Key is not available use a non-transient <strong>UUID</strong> which is created when the entity is initialised; See <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20171211235806/http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/09/13/dont-let-hibernate-steal-your-identity.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this great article</a> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>never</strong> refer to related entities (ManyToOne); if this entity (like a parent entity) needs to be part of the Business Key then compare the ID's only. Calling getId() on a proxy will not trigger the loading of the entity, as long as you're using <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3736818/hibernate-generating-sql-queries-when-accessing-associated-entitys-id/3739197#3739197"">property access type</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Entity</h2>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""ROOM"")
public class Room implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    @Column(name = ""room_id"")
    private Integer id;

    @Column(name = ""number"") 
    private String number; //immutable

    @Column(name = ""capacity"")
    private Integer capacity;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)
    @JoinColumn(name = ""building_id"")

        }
        // a room can be uniquely identified by it's number and the building it belongs to; normally I would use a UUID in any case but this is just to illustrate the usage of getId()
        final Room other = (Room) otherObj;
        return new EqualsBuilder().append(getNumber(), other.getNumber())
                .append(getBuilding().getId(), other.getBuilding().getId())
                .isEquals();
        //this assumes that Building.id is annotated with @Access(value = AccessType.PROPERTY) 
    }

    public Building getBuilding() {
        return building;
    }


    public Integer getId() {
        return id;

<p>I can evaluate it with</p>
<pre><code>if (a != 0 && b != 0) { /* Some code */ }
</code></pre>
<p>Or alternatively</p>
<pre><code>if (a*b != 0) { /* Some code */ }
</code></pre>
<p>Because I expect that piece of code to run millions of times per run, I was wondering which one would be faster. I did the experiment by comparing them on a huge randomly generated array, and I was also curious to see how the sparsity of the array (fraction of data = 0) would affect the results:</p>
<pre><code>long time;
final int len = 50000000;
int arbitrary = 0;
int[][] nums = new int[2][len];

for (double fraction = 0 ; fraction <= 0.9 ; fraction += 0.0078125) {
    for(int i = 0 ; i < 2 ; i++) {
        for(int j = 0 ; j < len ; j++) {
            double random = Math.random();

            if(random < fraction) nums[i][j] = 0;
            else nums[i][j] = (int) (random*15 + 1);
        }
    }

    time = System.currentTimeMillis();

    for(int i = 0 ; i < len ; i++) {
        if( /*insert nums[0][i]*nums[1][i]!=0 or nums[0][i]!=0 && nums[1][i]!=0*/ ) arbitrary++;
    }
    System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - time);
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the results show that if you expect ""a"" or ""b"" to be equal to 0 more than ~3% of the time, <code>a*b != 0</code> is faster than <code>a!=0 && b!=0</code>:</p>

<p>I'm curious to know why. Could anyone shed some light? Is it the compiler or is it at the hardware level?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>Out of curiosity...</em> now that I learned about branch prediction, I was wondering what the analog comparison would show for a <strong>OR</strong> b is non-zero:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/GpJoM.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/GpJoM.png"" alt=""Graph of a or b non-zero"" /></a></p>
<p>We do see the same effect of branch prediction as expected, interestingly the graph is somewhat flipped along the X-axis.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>1- I added <code>!(a==0 || b==0)</code> to the analysis to see what happens.</p>
<p>2- I also included <code>a != 0 || b != 0</code>, <code>(a+b) != 0</code> and <code>(a|b) != 0</code> out of curiosity, after learning about branch prediction. But they are not logically equivalent to the other expressions, because only a <em>OR</em> b needs to be non-zero to return true, so they are not meant to be compared for processing efficiency.</p>
<p>3- I also added the actual benchmark that I used for the analysis, which is just iterating an arbitrary int variable.</p>
<p>4- Some people were suggesting to include <code>a != 0 & b != 0</code> as opposed to <code>a != 0 && b != 0</code>, with the prediction that it would behave more closely to <code>a*b != 0</code> because we would remove the branch prediction effect. I didn't know that <code>&</code> could be used with boolean variables, I thought it was only used for binary operations with integers.</p>
<p>Note: In the context that I was considering all this, int overflow is not an issue, but that's definitely an important consideration in general contexts.</p>

So I copied <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>java.math.BigInteger</code></a> source into my own package and tried this:</p>

<pre><code>//import java.math.BigInteger;

        long tm = 0, count = 0,result=0;

            int s1 = 400, s2 = 400;
            BigInteger a = new BigInteger(s1 * 8, r), b = new BigInteger(s2 * 8, r);
            long tm1 = System.nanoTime();
            BigInteger c = a.multiply(b);
            if (i > 100000) {

        System.out.println(result); 
    }
}

<p>When I run this (jdk 1.8.0_144-b01 on MacOS) it outputs:</p>

<pre><code>12089nsec/mul

</code></pre>

<p>When I run it with the import line uncommented:</p>

<pre><code>4098nsec/mul

<p>It's almost three times as fast when using the JDK version of BigInteger versus my version, even if it's using the exact same code.</p>

<p>I've examined the bytecode with javap, and compared compiler output when running with options:</p>

<pre><code>-Xbatch -XX:-TieredCompilation -XX:+PrintCompilation -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions 
-XX:+PrintInlining -XX:CICompilerCount=1

<p>and both versions seem to generate the same code.
So is hotspot using some precomputed optimisations that I can't use in my code? I always understood that they don't.

And if not, any good suggestions for managing the environment variable changes that I'm going to need to be feeding to several subprocesses?</p>

Here it is: <a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?d1=16&m1=12&y1=1984&d2=9&m2=9&y2=2014&h1=7&i1=45&s1=55&h2=19&i2=46&s2=45"">Calculate duration between two dates</a> (result: 29 years, 8 months, 24 days, 12 hours, 0 minutes and 50 seconds).</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Since I got two different results from two different sites, I am wondering if the algorithm of my calculation is legitimate or not. If I use following two <code>LocalDateTime</code> objects:</p>

<pre><code>LocalDateTime toDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, 9, 10, 6, 40, 45);
LocalDateTime fromDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(1984, 12, 16, 7, 45, 55);
</code></pre>

<p>Then the output is coming: <code>29 years 8 months 25 days -1 hours -5 minutes -10 seconds.</code></p>

<p>From this <a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?d1=16&m1=12&y1=1984&d2=10&m2=9&y2=2014&h1=7&i1=45&s1=55&h2=6&i2=40&s2=45"">link</a> it should be <code>29 years 8 months 24 days 22 hours, 54 minutes and 50 seconds</code>. So the algorithm needs to handle the negative numbers too.</p>

<p><strong>Note the question is not about which site gave me what result, I need to know the right algorithm and need to have right results.</strong></p>

<pre><code>if (opt.isPresent()) {
  System.out.println(""found"");
} else {
  System.out.println(""Not found"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is not a 'functional style', though.</p>

<p><code>Optional</code> has an <code>ifPresent()</code> method, but I am unable to chain an <code>orElse()</code> method.</p>

<p>Thus, I cannot write:</p>

<pre><code>opt.ifPresent( x -> System.out.println(""found "" + x))
   .orElse( System.out.println(""NOT FOUND""));
</code></pre>

<p>In reply to @assylias, I don't think <code>Optional.map()</code> works for the following case:</p>

<pre><code>opt.map( o -> {
  System.out.println(""while opt is present..."");
  o.setProperty(xxx);
  dao.update(o);
  return null;
}).orElseGet( () -> {
  System.out.println(""create new obj"");
  dao.save(new obj);
  return null;
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, when <code>opt</code> is present, I update its property and save to the database. When it is not available, I create a new <code>obj</code> and save to the database.</p>

<p>Note in the two lambdas I have to return <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>But when <code>opt</code> is present, both lambdas will be executed. <code>obj</code> will be updated, and a new object will be saved to the database . This is because of the <code>return null</code> in the first lambda. And <code>orElseGet()</code> will continue to execute.</p>

Maybe is this a bug related to Maven running in Java 8?
How could I make it work (i.e., being able to build the Javadoc of the project and install its code in my local repository) with Java 8?
I have tested with both Maven 3.0.3 and 3.0.5 in OSX.</p>

A <em>(quite pointless)</em> example in Java:</p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> declaration before loop:</p>

<pre><code>double intermediateResult;
for(int i=0; i < 1000; i++){
    intermediateResult = i;
    System.out.println(intermediateResult);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>b)</strong> declaration (repeatedly) inside loop:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0; i < 1000; i++){
    double intermediateResult = i;
    System.out.println(intermediateResult);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which one is better, <strong>a</strong> or <strong>b</strong>? </p>

<p>I suspect that repeated variable declaration (example <strong>b</strong>) creates more overhead <em>in theory</em>, but that compilers are smart enough so that it doesn't matter. Example <strong>b</strong> has the advantage of being more compact and limiting the scope of the variable to where it is used. Still, I tend to code according example <strong>a</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong> I am especially interested in the Java case.</p>

It's really all static, no serverside logic to program. I should mention I'm completely new to Java. JSP files seem to make it easy to work with common includes and variables, much like <code>PHP</code>, but I'd like to know a simple way to get something like template inheritance (<code>Django</code> style) or at least be able to have a base.jsp file containing the header and the footer, so I can insert content later.</p>

<p><em>Ben Lings</em> seems to offer some hope in his answer here:
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/490390/jsp-template-inheritance"">JSP template inheritance</a>
Can someone explain how to achieve this?</p>

<p>Given that I don't have much time I think dynamic routing is a little much, so I'm happy to just to have URLs map directly onto <code>.jsp</code> files, but I'm open to suggestion.</p>

<p><em>Thanks.</em></p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> I don't want to use any external libraries, because it would increase the learning curve for myself and others who work on the project, and the company I work for has been contracted to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Another edit:</strong> I'm not sure if <code>JSP tags</code> will be useful because my content doesn't really have any template variables. What I need is a way to be able to do this:</p>

<p><code>base.html:</code></p>

{ content.body }
</body></html>

<p><code>somepage.html</code></p>

<p>The <code>orElseGet()</code> method takes a Supplier functional interface, which essentially does not take any parameters and returns <code>T</code>.</p>
<p>In which situation would you need to use <code>orElseGet()</code>? If you have a method <code>T myDefault()</code> why wouldn't you just do <code>optional.orElse(myDefault())</code> rather than <code>optional.orElseGet(() -> myDefault())</code> ?</p>
<p>It does not seem that <code>orElseGet()</code> is postponing the execution of the lambda expression to some later time or something, so what's the point of it? (I would have thought that it would be more useful if it returned a safer <code>Optional<T></code> whose <code>get()</code> never throws a <code>NoSuchElementException</code> and <code>isPresent()</code> always returns true... but evidently its not, it just returns <code>T</code> like <code>orElse()</code>).</p>

<p>According to this article <a href=""http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/synchronization_volatile.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/synchronization_volatile.shtml</a> there is a lot to be said and there are many differences but also some similarities.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in this piece of info:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>access to a volatile variable never has the potential to block: we're only ever doing a simple read or write, so unlike a synchronized block we will never hold on to any lock;</li>
  <li>because accessing a volatile variable never holds a lock, it is not suitable for cases where we want to <strong>read-update-write</strong> as an atomic operation (unless we're prepared to ""miss an update"");</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What do they mean by <strong>read-update-write</strong>? Isn't a write also an update or do they simply mean that the <strong>update</strong> is a write that depends on the read?</p>

<p>Most of all, when is it more suitable to declare variables <code>volatile</code> rather than access them through a <code>synchronized</code> block? Is it a good idea to use <code>volatile</code> for variables that depend on input? For instance, there is a variable called <code>render</code> that is read through the rendering loop and set by a keypress event?</p>

This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.</p>

<p>I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.</p>

<p>I know one method of doing this is to use the <code>String.format</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91239
</code></pre>

<p>which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: </p>

<pre><code>String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91230
</code></pre>

<p>Another method is to use the <code>DecimalFormatter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91238
</code></pre>

<p>However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:</p>

<pre><code>0.912385 -> 0.91239
0.912300 -> 0.9123

<blockquote>
  <p>The method must override a superclass method</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects for whatever reason, the method argument values are not always populated, so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //These arguments have their correct names
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, 
                                    ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {                 
    }

<p>will be initially populated like this:</p>

<pre><code>list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //This methods arguments were not automatically provided    
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu arg1, View arg2,
                                    ContextMenuInfo arg3) {
    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>The odd thing is, if I remove my code, and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method, it uses the same argument names I already had, so I don't really know where the problem is, other then it auto-formatting the method for me.</p>

<p>This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.</p>

<p>Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?</p>

  <p>Use checked exceptions for

<p>Let's see if I understand this correctly.</p>

<p>Here is my understanding of a checked exception:</p>

    Long id = Long.parseLong(userInput);
}catch(NumberFormatException e){
    id = 0; //recover the situation by setting the id to 0

<p><strong>2. Is RuntimeException an unchecked exception?</strong></p>

<pre><code>try{
    File file = new File(""my/file/path"");
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){

//3. What should I do here?
    //Should I ""throw new FileNotFoundException(""File not found"");""?
    //Should I log?
    //Or should I System.exit(0);?
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>4. Now, couldn't the above code also be a checked exception? I can try to recover the situation like this? Can I?</strong> (Note: my 3rd question is inside the <code>catch</code> above)</p>

<pre><code>try{
    String filePath = //read in from user input file path
    File file = new File(filePath);
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){
    //Kindly prompt the user an error message
    //Somehow ask the user to re-enter the file path.
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>5. Why do people do this?</strong></p>

<pre><code>public void someMethod throws Exception{

}
</code></pre>

<p>Why do they let the exception bubble up? Isn't handling the error sooner better? Why bubble up? </p>

<p>It seems like this ought to be simple, but if it is, I am missing something.</p>
<p>Any pointers on how to do this are greatly appreciated. Short of that, if there is a simple way to point maven to a <code>/lib</code> directory and easily create a <code>pom.xml</code> with all the enclosed jars mapped to a single dependency which I could then name / install and link to in one fell swoop would also suffice.</p>

I'm struggling to find a logical reason why.  For example I have a piece of logic which has 2 optional parameters.  Therefore I think it would make sense to write my method signature like this (solution 1):</p>
<pre><code>public int calculateSomething(Optional<String> p1, Optional<BigDecimal> p2) {
    // my logic
}
</code></pre>
<p>Many web pages specify Optional should not be used as method arguments. With this in mind, I could use the following method signature and add a clear Javadoc comment to specify that the arguments may be null, hoping future maintainers will read the Javadoc and therefore always carry out null checks prior to using the arguments (solution 2):</p>
<pre><code>public int calculateSomething(String p1, BigDecimal p2) {
    // my logic
}
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively I could replace my method with four public methods to provide a nicer interface and make it more obvious p1 and p2 are optional (solution 3):</p>
<pre><code>public int calculateSomething() {
    calculateSomething(null, null);
}

public int calculateSomething(String p1) {
    calculateSomething(p1, null);
}

public int calculateSomething(BigDecimal p2) {
    calculateSomething(null, p2);
}

public int calculateSomething(String p1, BigDecimal p2) {
    // my logic
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now I try writing the code of the class which invokes this piece of logic for each approach.  I first retrieve the two input parameters from another object which returns <code>Optional</code>s and then, I invoke <code>calculateSomething</code>.  Therefore, if solution 1 is used the calling code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Optional<String> p1 = otherObject.getP1();
Optional<BigInteger> p2 = otherObject.getP2();
int result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1, p2);
</code></pre>
<p>if solution 2 is used, the calling code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Optional<String> p1 = otherObject.getP1();
Optional<BigInteger> p2 = otherObject.getP2();
int result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1.orElse(null), p2.orElse(null));
</code></pre>
<p>if solution 3 is applied, I could use the code above or I could use the following (but it's significantly more code):</p>
<pre><code>Optional<String> p1 = otherObject.getP1();
Optional<BigInteger> p2 = otherObject.getP2();
int result;
if (p1.isPresent()) {
    if (p2.isPresent()) {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1, p2);
    } else {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1);
    }
} else {
    if (p2.isPresent()) {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p2);
    } else {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>So my question is: Why is it considered bad practice to use <code>Optional</code>s as method arguments (see solution 1)?</strong>  It looks like the most readable solution to me and makes it most obvious that the parameters could be empty/null to future maintainers.  (I'm aware the designers of <code>Optional</code> intended it to only be used as a return type, but I can't find any logical reasons not to use it in this scenario).</p>

As an example: currently, I am running a batch job where I need to calculate the next run based on dates and I am struggling to find pros/cons between these two types (apart from the nanosecond precision advantage of <code>Instant</code> and the time-zone part of <code>LocalDateTime</code>).</p>
<p>Can you name some application examples where only <code>Instant</code> or <code>LocalDateTime</code> should be used?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract
   and cannot have implementations. A Java abstract class can have
   instance methods that implements a default behaviour.</p>
  
  <p>Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. An 
   abstract class may contain non-final variables.</p>
  
  <p>Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract
   class can have the usual flavours of class members like private,
   protected, etc.</p>
  
  <p>A Java interface should be implemented using keyword “implements”; A
  Java abstract class should be extended using keyword “extends”.</p>
  
  <p>An interface can extend another Java interface only, an abstract class
   can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.</p>
  
  <p>A Java class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only
   one abstract class.</p>

I'm wondering how to refactor some code for better performance that is getting run a bunch of times.</p>

<p>Say I'm creating a word frequency list, using a Map (probably a HashMap), where each key is a String with the word that's being counted and the value is an Integer that's incremented each time a token of the word is found.</p>

<p>In Perl, incrementing such a value would be trivially easy:</p>

<pre><code>$map{$word}++;
</code></pre>

<p>But in Java, it's much more complicated. Here the way I'm currently doing it:</p>

<pre><code>int count = map.containsKey(word) ? map.get(word) : 0;
map.put(word, count + 1);
</code></pre>

<p>Which of course relies on the autoboxing feature in the newer Java versions. I wonder if you can suggest a more efficient way of incrementing such a value. Are there even good performance reasons for eschewing the Collections framework and using a something else instead?</p>

<p>Imagine that I have a server application and I would like to use parallel streams. But the application is large and multi-threaded so I want to compartmentalize it. I do not want a slow running task in one module of the applicationblock tasks from another module.</p>

<p>If I can not use different thread pools for different modules, it means I can not safely use parallel streams in most of real world situations.</p>

<p>Try the following example. There are some CPU intensive tasks executed in separate threads.
The tasks leverage parallel streams. The first task is broken, so each step takes 1 second (simulated by thread sleep). The issue is that other threads get stuck and wait for the broken task to finish. This is contrived example, but imagine a servlet app and someone submitting a long running task to the shared fork join pool. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/416183/in-java-critical-sections-what-should-i-synchronize-on#416198"">some <em>evil code</em> may steal your lock</a> (very popular this one, also has an ""accidentally"" variant)</li>

<p>Other people, including me, argue that <code>synchronized(this)</code> is an idiom that is used a lot (also in Java libraries), is safe and well understood. It should not be avoided because you have a bug and you don't have a clue of what is going on in your multithreaded program. In other words: if it is applicable, then use it.</p>

<p>I am interested in seeing some real-world examples (no foobar stuff) where avoiding a lock on <code>this</code> is preferable when <code>synchronized(this)</code> would also do the job.</p>

<li>if you quote Bloch or other authorities on the subject, don't leave out the parts you don't like (e.g. Effective Java, item on Thread Safety: <em>Typically it is the lock on the instance itself, but there are exceptions.)</em></li>
<li>if you need granularity in your locking other than <code>synchronized(this)</code> provides, then <code>synchronized(this)</code> is not applicable so that's not the issue</li>

I understand that Java does not pass methods as parameters, however, I would like to get an alternative. </p>

<p>I've been told interfaces are the alternative to passing methods as parameters but I don't understand how an interface can act as a method by reference. If I understand correctly an interface is simply an abstract set of methods that are not defined. I don't want to send an interface that needs to be defined every time because several different methods could call the same method with the same parameters.</p>

<p>What I would like to accomplish is something similar to this:</p>

        myMethod(leaf);

Most (if not all) of them depend on Hibernate, but I'd like to discuss them JPA-implementation-neutrally (I am using EclipseLink, by the way).</p>

<p>All possible implementations are having their own <strong>advantages</strong> and <strong>disadvantages</strong> regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code></strong> contract <strong>conformity</strong> (immutability) for <code>List</code>/<code>Set</code> operations</li>
<li>Whether <strong>identical</strong> objects (e.g. from different sessions, dynamic proxies from lazily-loaded data structures) can be detected</li>
<li>Whether entities behave correctly in <strong>detached (or non-persisted) state</strong> 
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>As far I can see, there are <strong>three options</strong>: </p>

<ol>
<li>Do not override them; rely on <code>Object.equals()</code> and <code>Object.hashCode()</code>

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> work</li>
<li>cannot identify identical objects, problems with dynamic proxies</li>
<li>no problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Override them, based on the <strong>primary key</strong>

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken</li>
<li>correct identity (for all managed entities)</li>
<li>problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Override them, based on the <strong>Business-Id</strong> (non-primary key fields; what about foreign keys?)

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken</li>
<li>correct identity (for all managed entities)</li>
<li>no problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Did I miss an option and/or pro/con point?<br></li>
<li>What option did you choose and why?</li>
</ol>

<p><br><br>
<strong>UPDATE 1:</strong></p>

<p>By ""<code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken"", I mean that successive <code>hashCode()</code> invocations may return differing values, which is (when correctly implemented) not broken in the sense of the <code>Object</code> API documentation, but which causes problems when trying to retrieve a changed entity from a <code>Map</code>,  <code>Set</code> or other hash-based <code>Collection</code>.  Consequently, JPA implementations (at least EclipseLink) will not work correctly in some cases.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for your answers -- most of them have remarkable quality.<br>
Unfortunately, I am still unsure which approach will be the best for a real-life application, or how to determine the best approach for my application.  So, I'll keep the question open and hope for some more discussions and/or opinions.</p>

</li>
<li><p>then we push to Bitbucket;</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li><p>in <code>application.properties</code> we can not hard code the MySQL info.

  spring.datasource.username = 
  spring.datasource.password =

<pre><code>export OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST=""jdbc:mysql://localhost""
export OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT=""3306""
export OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME=""root""
export OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD=""123asd""

<pre><code>String password = env.get(""OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD"");   
String userName = env.get(""OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME"");   
String sqlURL = env.get(""OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST""); 
String sqlPort = env.get(""OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT"");

<p>Now the only thing left is we need to use these java variables in our <code>application.properties</code>, and that is what we are having trouble with.</p>
<p>In which folder, and how, do we need to assign the <code>password</code>, <code>userName</code>, <code>sqlURL</code>, and <code>sqlPort</code> variables for <code>application.properties</code> to be able to see them and how do we include them in <code>application.properties</code>?</p>
<p>We have tried many things one of them being:</p>
<pre><code>spring.datasource.url = ${sqlURL}:${sqlPort}/""nameofDB""
spring.datasource.username = ${userName}
spring.datasource.password = ${password}
</code></pre>
<p>No luck so far.  We are probably not putting these environment variables in the right class/folder or are using them incorrectly in <code>application.properties</code>.</p>

There are essentially two reasons (there may be others) why they have been introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing actual default implementations. Example: <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html#remove--"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Iterator.remove()</code></a></li>
<li>Allowing for JDK API evolution. Example: <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html#forEach-java.util.function.Consumer-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Iterable.forEach()</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>From an API designer's perspective, I would have liked to be able to use other modifiers on interface methods, e.g. <code>final</code>. This would be useful when adding convenience methods, preventing ""accidental"" overrides in implementing classes:</p>
<pre><code>interface Sender {

    // Convenience method to send an empty message
    default final void send() {
        send(null);
    }

    // Implementations should only implement this method
    void send(String message);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The above is already common practice if <code>Sender</code> were a class:</p>
<pre><code>abstract class Sender {

    // Convenience method to send an empty message
    final void send() {
        send(null);
    }

    // Implementations should only implement this method
    abstract void send(String message);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>default</code> and <code>final</code> are obviously contradicting keywords, but the default keyword itself <a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-dev/2012-August/005393.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">would not have been strictly required</a>, so I'm assuming that this contradiction is deliberate, to reflect the subtle differences between <em>""class methods with body""</em> (just methods) and <em>""interface methods with body""</em> (default methods), i.e. differences which I have not yet understood.</p>
<p>At some point of time, support for modifiers like <code>static</code> and <code>final</code> on interface methods was not yet fully explored, <a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-dev/2011-December/004430.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">citing Brian Goetz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other part is how far we're going to go to support class-building
tools in interfaces, such as final methods, private methods, protected
methods, static methods, etc.  The answer is: we don't know yet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since that time in late 2011, obviously, support for <code>static</code> methods in interfaces was added. Clearly, this added a lot of value to the JDK libraries themselves, such as with <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#comparing-java.util.function.Function-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Comparator.comparing()</code></a>.</p>

<p>I was told there that it's bad practice, but then I was also told that garbage collector runs don't systematically stop the world anymore, and that it could also effectively be used by the JVM only as a hint, so I'm kind of at loss.</p>

<p>I do understand that the JVM usually knows better than you when it needs to reclaim memory. I also understand that worrying about a few kilobytes of data is silly. I also understand that even megabytes of data isn't what it was a few years back. But still, 1.5 gigabytes? And you <em>know</em> there's like 1.5 GB of data hanging around in memory; it's not like it's a shot in the dark. Is <code>System.gc()</code> systematically bad, or is there some point at which it becomes okay?</p>

<p>So the question is actually double:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is or isn't it bad practice to call <code>System.gc()</code>? Is it really merely a hint to the JVM under certain implementations, or is it always a full collection cycle?

While I know that OO design generally tries to avoid using <code>instanceof</code>, that is a different story and this question is purely related to performance. I was wondering if there is any performance impact? Is is just as fast as <code>==</code>?</p>

<p>For example, I have a base class with 10 subclasses. In a single function that takes the base class, I do checks for if the class is an instance of the subclass and carry out some routine. </p>

<p>One of the other ways I thought of solving it was to use a ""type id"" integer primitive instead, and use a bitmask to represent categories of the subclasses, and then just do a bit mask comparison of the subclasses ""type id"" to a constant mask representing the category.</p>

<p>Is <code>instanceof</code> somehow optimized by the JVM to be faster than that? I want to stick to Java but the performance of the app is critical. It would be cool if someone that has been down this road before could offer some advice. Am I nitpicking too much or focusing on the wrong thing to optimize?</p>

<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5579744/what-is-the-difference-between-pathparam-and-queryparam"">What is the difference between @PathParam and @QueryParam</a></p>

<p>This is a ""best practices"" or convention question.</p>

<p>When would you use <code>@PathParam</code> vs <code>@QueryParam</code>.</p>

<p>What I can think of that the decision might be using the two to differentiate the information pattern. Let me illustrate below my LTPO - less than perfect observation.</p>

<p>PathParam use could be reserved for information category, which would fall nicely into a branch of an information tree. PathParam could be used to drill down to entity class hierarchy.</p>

<p>Whereas, QueryParam could be reserved for specifying attributes to locate the instance of a class.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/Vehicle/Car?registration=123</code></li>
<li><code>/House/Colonial?region=newengland</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>/category?instance</code></p>

<pre><code>@GET
@Path(""/employee/{dept}"")
Patient getEmployee(@PathParam(""dept"")Long dept, @QueryParam(""id"")Long id) ;
</code></pre>

<p>vs <code>/category/instance</code></p>

<pre><code>@GET
@Path(""/employee/{dept}/{id}"")
Patient getEmployee(@PathParam(""dept"")Long dept, @PathParam(""id"")Long id) ;
</code></pre>

<p>vs <code>?category+instance</code></p>

<pre><code>@GET
@Path(""/employee"")
Patient getEmployee(@QueryParam(""dept"")Long dept, @QueryParam(""id"")Long id) ;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think there is a standard convention of doing it. Is there? However, I would like to hear of how people use PathParam vs QueryParam to differentiate their information like I exemplified above. I would also love to hear the reason behind the practice.</p>

All I want
to do is empty <code>field2</code> when <code>field1</code> is changed and vice versa. So at the end only
one field has content on it.</p>

<pre><code>field1 = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.field1);

<p>It works fine if I attach <code>addTextChangedListener</code> to <code>field1</code> only, but when
I do it for both fields the app crashes. Obviously because they try to change
each other indefinitely. Once <code>field1</code> changes it clears <code>field2</code> at this moment
<code>field2</code> is changed so it will clear <code>field1</code> and so on...</p>

<p>Still, I don't fully understand the concept, and especially when it is safe or dangerous to user <strong>inner classes inside an Activity</strong>.</p>

<p>This is what I understood:</p>

<p>A memory leak will occur if an instance of an inner class survives longer than its outer class (an Activity).
-> <strong>In which situations can this happen?</strong> </p>

<p>In this example, I suppose there is no risk of leak, because there is no way the anonymous class extending <code>OnClickListener</code> will live longer than the activity, right?</p>

<pre><code>    final Dialog dialog = new Dialog(this);
    dialog.setContentView(R.layout.dialog_generic);
    Button okButton = (Button) dialog.findViewById(R.id.dialog_button_ok);
    TextView titleTv = (TextView) dialog.findViewById(R.id.dialog_generic_title);

    // *** Handle button click
    okButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
        public void onClick(View v) {
            dialog.dismiss();
        }
    });

    titleTv.setText(""dialog title"");
    dialog.show();
</code></pre>

<p>Now, is this example dangerous, and why?</p>

<pre><code>// We are still inside an Activity
_handlerToDelayDroidMove = new Handler();
_handlerToDelayDroidMove.postDelayed(_droidPlayRunnable, 10000);

private Runnable _droidPlayRunnable = new Runnable() { 
    public void run() {
        _someFieldOfTheActivity.performLongCalculation();
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I have a doubt regarding the fact that understanding this topic has to do with understanding in detail what is kept when an activity is destroyed and re-created.</p>

<p>Is it?</p>

<p>Let say I just changed the orientation of the device (which is the most common cause of leaks). When <code>super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)</code> will be called in my <code>onCreate()</code>, will this restore the values of the fields (as they were before orientation change)? Will this also restore the states of inner classes?</p>

<p>I realize my question is not very precise, but I'd really appreciate any explanation that could make things clearer.</p>

Using JPARepository how do I update an entity?</p>

<p>JPARepository has only a <strong>save</strong> method, which does not tell me if it's create or update actually. For example, I insert a simple Object to the database User, which has three fields: <code>firstname</code>, <code>lastname</code> and <code>age</code>:</p>

<pre><code> @Entity
 public class User {

  private String firstname;
  private String lastname;
  //Setters and getters for age omitted, but they are the same as with firstname and lastname.
  private int age;

  @Column
  public String getFirstname() {
    return firstname;
  }
  public void setFirstname(String firstname) {
    this.firstname = firstname;
  }

  @Column
  public String getLastname() {
    return lastname;
  }
  public void setLastname(String lastname) {
    this.lastname = lastname;
  }

  private long userId;

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
  public long getUserId(){
    return this.userId;
  }

  public void setUserId(long userId){
    this.userId = userId;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I simply call <code>save()</code>, which at this point is actually an insert into database:</p>

<pre><code> User user1 = new User();
 user1.setFirstname(""john""); user1.setLastname(""dew"");
 user1.setAge(16);

 userService.saveUser(user1);// This call is actually using the JPARepository: userRepository.save(user);
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good. Now I want to update this user, say change his age. For this purpose I could use a Query, either QueryDSL or NamedQuery, whatever. But, considering I just want to use spring-data-jpa and the JPARepository, how do I tell it that instead of an insert I want to do an update? </p>

<p>Specifically, how do I tell spring-data-jpa that users with the same username and firstname are actually EQUAL and that the existing entity supposed to be updated? Overriding equals did not solve this problem.</p>

<hr>

<p>I occasionally find myself needing to make a private method in a class public just to write some unit tests for it.</p>

<p>Usually this would be because the method contains logic shared between other methods in the class and it's tidier to test the logic on its own, or another reason could be possible be I want to test logic used in synchronous threads without having to worry about threading problems.</p>

<p>Do other people find themselves doing this, because I don't really like doing it?? I personally think the bonuses outweigh the problems of making a method public which doesn't really provide any service outside of the class...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for answers everyone, seems to have piqued peoples' interest. I think the general consensus is testing should happen via the public API as this is the only way a class will ever be used, and I do agree with this. The couple of cases I mentioned above where I would do this above were uncommon cases and I thought the benefits of doing it was worth it.</p>

<p>I can however, see everyones point that it should never really happen.

Authentication for the webservice is using a client certificate, a username and a password. The client certificate I received from the company behind the webservice is in <code>.cer</code> format.

<pre><code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
[Some base64 encoded data]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

<p>I can import this file as a certificate in Internet Explorer (without having to enter a password!) and use it to authenticate with the webservice.</p>

<p>I was able to import this certificate into a keystore by first stripping the first and last line, converting to unix newlines and running a base64-decode. The resulting file can be imported into a keystore (using the <code>keytool</code> command). When I list the entries in the keystore, this entry is of the type <code>trustedCertEntry</code>. Because of this entry type (?) I cannot use this certificate to authenticate with the webservice. I'm beginning to think that the provided certificate is a public certificate which is being used for authentication...</p>

<p>A workaround I have found is to import the certificate in IE and export it as a <code>.pfx</code> file. This file can be loaded as a keystore and can be used to authenticate with the webservice. However I cannot expect my clients to perform these steps every time they receive a new certificate. So I would like to load the <code>.cer</code> file directly into Java. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Doing a search online brought up this link: <a href=""http://balanceandbreath.blogspot.ca/2013/01/utilnativecodeloader-unable-to-load.html"">http://balanceandbreath.blogspot.ca/2013/01/utilnativecodeloader-unable-to-load.html</a></p>

<p>However, the contents of <code>/native/</code> directory on hadoop 2.x appear to be different so I am not sure what to do.</p>

<p>I've also added these two environment variables in <code>hadoop-env.sh</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>export HADOOP_OPTS=""$HADOOP_OPTS
  -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/hadoop/lib/""</p>
  
  <p>export HADOOP_COMMON_LIB_NATIVE_DIR=""/usr/local/hadoop/lib/native/""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Any ideas?</em></p>

These Strings have all to be collected (without breaking up into smaller amounts) before being submitted to a database.</p>

<p>According to Sun, the error happens ""if too much time is being spent in garbage collection: if more than 98% of the total time is spent in garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is recovered, an OutOfMemoryError will be thrown."".</p>

<p>Apparently, one could use the command line to pass arguments to the JVM for</p>

<ul>
<li>Increasing the heap size, via ""-Xmx1024m"" (or more), or </li>
<li>Disabling the error check altogether, via ""-XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit"".</li>
</ul>

<p>The first approach works fine, the second ends up in another java.lang.OutOfMemoryError, this time about the heap.</p>

<p>So, question: is there any programmatic alternative to this, for the particular use case (i.e., several small HashMap objects)? If I use the HashMap clear() method, for instance, the problem goes away, but so do the data stored in the HashMap! :-)</p>

<p>The issue is also discussed in a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1393486/what-means-the-error-message-java-lang-outofmemoryerror-gc-overhead-limit-excee"">related topic in StackOverflow.</a></p>
